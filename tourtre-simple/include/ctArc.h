\brief Arc of the contour tree

The ctArc structure is an arc of the contour tree. Together with ctNode, it forms the contour tree data structure.
It connects two ctNode objects, hi and lo. You can store extra information in the data field.
For example, you might want to keep track of which vertices map to this arc. This information can be obtained using
the \ref ct_vertexFunc callback. This will be called once for each vertex which maps to this arc. If you do store
information in the data field, you will also want to implement the \ref ct_arcMergeFunc callback, which should accumulate
the data stored in two merged arcs.
