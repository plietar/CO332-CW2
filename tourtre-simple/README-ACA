This package is extracted from Scott Dillard's library "libtourtre",
for computing contour trees.  The original full distribution can be downloaded from
   http://graphics.cs.ucdavis.edu/~sdillard/libtourtre/doc/html/

It has been extracted in order to simplify its use in the 2017
Advanced Computer Architecture course at Imperial College London.  I
have removed all the example programs except one, "simple".  I have
modified the build procedure so everything is simply compiled together
(the original distribution builds a .a or .so library against which
the applications, such as "simple", are linked).
